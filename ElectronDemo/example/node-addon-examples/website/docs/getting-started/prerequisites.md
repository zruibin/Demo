##  C/C++ and JavaScript 

The purpose of Node-API is to enable you to use your existing or newly written C/C++ code from JavaScript. This assumes at least a passing familiarity with both JavaScript and C/C++. The level of familiarity necessary is dependent upon the complexity of your project and your involvement with the JavaScript and the C/C++. 

For your own projects, it will be necessary to have an understanding of the C/C++ code you plan to integrate as well as what objectives you hope to achieve with your project on the JavaScript side of things.
