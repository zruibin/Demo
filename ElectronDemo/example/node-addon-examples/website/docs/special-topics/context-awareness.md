## Background

Node.js has historically run as a single-threaded process. This all changed with the introduction of [Worker Threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker_threads_worker_threads) in Node 10. Worker Threads add a JavaScript-friendly concurrency abstraction that native add-on developers need to be aware of. What this means practically is that your native add-on may be loaded and unloaded more than once and its code may be executed concurrently in multiple threads. There are specific steps you must take to insure your native add-on code runs correctly.

The Worker Thread model specifies that each Worker runs completely independently of each other and communicate to the parent Worker using a MessagePort object supplied by the parent. This makes the Worker Threads essentially isolated from one another. The same is true for your native add-on. 

Each Worker Thread operates within its own environment which is also referred to as a context. The context is available to each Node-API function as an [`napi_env`](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_napi_env) value.

## Multiple loading and unloading

If your native add-on requires persistent memory, allocating this memory in static global space is a recipe for disaster. Instead, it is *essential* that this memory is allocated each time within the context in which the native add-on is initialized. This memory is typically allocated in your native add-on's `Init` method. But in some cases it can also be allocated as your native add-on is running. 

In addition to the multiple loading described above, your native add-on is also subject to automatic unloading by the JavaScript runtime engine's garbage collector when your native add-on is no longer in use.  To prevent memory leaks, any memory your native add-on has allocated *must* be freed when you native add-on is unloaded. 

The next sections describe two different techniques you can use to allocate and free persistent memory  associated with your native add-on. The techniques may be used individually or together in your native add-on.

## Instance data

> Note that the feature described here is currently experimental in Node 12.8.0 and later. 

Node-API gives you the ability to associate a single piece of memory your native-add allocates with the context under which it is running. This technique is called "instance data" and is useful when your native add-on allocates a single piece of data when its loaded. 

The `napi_set_instance_data` allows your native add-on to associate a single piece of allocated memory with the context under which you native add-on is loaded. The `napi_get_instance_data` can then be called anywhere in you native add-on to retrieve the location of the memory that was allocated. 

You specify a finalizer callback in your `napi_set_instance_data` call. The finalizer callback gets called when your native add-on is released from memory and is where you should release the memory associated with this context.  

### Resources

[Environment Life Cycle APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_environment_life_cycle_apis) Node.js documentation for `napi_set_instance_data` and `napi_get_instance_data`.

### Example

In this example, a number of Worker Threads are created. Each Worker Thread creates an `AddonData` struct that is tied to the Worker Thread's context using a call to `napi_set_instance_data`. Over time, the value held in the struct is incremented and decremented using a computationally expensive operation. 

In time, the Worker Threads complete their operations at which time the allocated struct is freed in the `DeleteAddonData`Â function.

// Structure containing information needed for as long as the addon exists. It
// replaces the use of global static data with per-addon-instance data by
// associating an instance of this structure with each instance of this addon
// during addon initialization. The instance of this structure is then passed to
// each binding the addon provides. Thus, the data stored in an instance of this
// structure is available to each binding, just as global static data would be.
typedef struct {
  double value;
} AddonData;

// This is the actual, useful work performed: increment or decrement the value
// stored per addon instance after passing it through a CPU-consuming but
// otherwise useless calculation.
static int ModifyAddonData(AddonData* data, double offset) {
    // Expensively increment or decrement the value.

    data->value =
        (double)(((int)data->value) +

// environments, each in its own thread.
const {
  Worker, isMainThread
} = require('worker_threads');

// We load the native addon.
const addon = require('bindings')('multiple_load');

// The iteration count can be tweaked to ensure that the output from the two
// threads is interleaved. Too few iterations and the output of one thread
// follows the output of the other, not really illustrating the concurrency.
const iterations = 1000;

// This function is an idle loop that performs a random walk from 0 by calling
// into the native addon to either increment or decrement the initial value.
function useAddon(addon, prefix, iterations) {
  if (iterations >= 0) {
    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
      console.log(prefix + ': new value (decremented): ' + addon.decrement());
    } else {

if (isMainThread) {
  // On the main thread, we launch a worker and wait for it to come online. Then

  // On the secondary thread we immediately start the loop.
  useAddon(addon, "Worker thread", iterations);
}
```

## Cleanup hooks

> Note that the feature described here is currently available in Node-API version 3 and later. 

Your native add-on can receive one or more notifications from the Node.js runtime engine when the context in which your native-add-on has been running is being destroyed. This gives your native add-on the opportunity to release any allocated memory before the context is destroyed by the Node.js runtime engine.

The advantage of this technique is that your native add-on can allocate multiple pieces of memory to be associated with the context under which your native add-on is running. This can be useful if you need to allocate multiple memory buffers from different pieces of code as your native add-on is running. 

The drawback is that if you need to access these allocated buffer you are responsible for keeping track of the pointers yourself within the context your native add-on is running. Depending upon the architecture of your native add-on, this may or may not be an issue. 

### Resources

[Cleanup on exit of the current Node.js instance](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_cleanup_on_exit_of_the_current_node_js_instance) Node.js documentation for `napi_add_env_cleanup_hook` and `napi_remove_env_cleanup_hook`.

### Example

Because keeping track of the allocated buffers is dependent upon the architecture of the native add-on, this is a trivial example showing how the buffers can be allocated and released. 

#### binding.c

```c++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "node_api.h"

namespace {

void CleanupHook (void* arg) {
  printf("cleanup(%d)\n", *static_cast<int*>(arg));
  free(arg);
}

napi_value Init(napi_env env, napi_value exports) {
  for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    int* value = (int*)malloc(sizeof(*value));
    *value = i;
    napi_add_env_cleanup_hook(env, CleanupHook, value);
  }
  return nullptr;
}

}  // anonymous namespace

NAPI_MODULE(NODE_GYP_MODULE_NAME, Init)
```

#### index.js

```javascript
'use strict';
// We load the native addon.
const addon = require('bindings')('multiple_load');
const assert = require('assert');
const child_process = require('child_process');
```
