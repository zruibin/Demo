title: Welcome to the Node-API Resource
---

The goal of this site is to be a clearinghouse for everything related [Node's](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) ABI-Stable C/C++ API, [Node-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api).

If you are looking to make existing C/C++ code accessible to the widening universe of JavaScript projects, or if you have need to access operating system's resources from JavaScript, or if you have a particularly computationally intensive task that would benefit from hand-tuned C/C++ code accessible from JavaScript, Node-API may be a good fit for you.

This site is maintained by members of the Node.js Node-API team. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to answer your questions or make this site better. We welcome your feedback through the link available at the bottom of each page.
